# RsEngine

RsEngine is an SDK inspired by Valve’s Source Engine, focused on clean,
fast, and accessible development of full games.

The engine is designed with a strong separation between engine internals
and game content, allowing rapid iteration and long-term maintainability.

## Goals
- SDK-first architecture
- Stable DirectX 11 rendering backend
- Data- and physics-driven runtime
- Clear separation: engine vs content

## Non-goals (for now)
- Networking
- Integrated C# scripting
- Vulkan backend (DX11-first for simplicity and Linux compatibility later)

## Current Status
🧪 Early development — not production ready

## Build
(TODO)  
Source code will be released soon.

## A Few Words from the Development Team
RsEngine is a lightweight Software Development Kit primarily developed
for the **Project: RedZone** game.  
All engine decisions are driven by real production needs rather than
theoretical features.

Cheers,  
**Radiot Studios**
